Details:
The demo described in the spec was implemented exactly.

Mario initially comes into the screen from the upper left, scales from 0 to 1, and fades into existence.
This tween satisfied the non linear component of the lab. The positiony of mario moves downward in a
non linear way.

When Mario picks up the coin, the coin scales to 4x its original size and moves to the center of the screen.

After the coin has reached the center of the screen, the coin fades out.
